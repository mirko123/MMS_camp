Write a function
	void calc(FILE *in, FILE *out, queue_object *q);
where
		(1) "q" contains pointers (cast to void *) to external functions with the following prototype:
			typedef int (*F)(int);
		(2) "out" is a pointer to an open output stream
		(3) the "in" file structure is:
		--- cut ---
#0 1 3 7 <- defines a composition #0 of functions, F1(F3(F7(.))), keys in q 1, 3 and 7
#1 2 5 <- defines a composition #1 of functions, F2(F5(.)), keys in q 2 and 5
#3 5 7 <- ...
#4 0 4 5 <- ...
#5 3 4 6 <- defines a composition #5 of functions, F3(F4(F6(.))), keys in q 3, 4 and 6
$0 5 <- computes composition #0 of 5: F1(F3(F7(5)))
$1 7 <- computes composition #1 of 7: F2(F5(7))
$3 15 <- ...
$4 9 <- ...
$5 10 <- computes composition #1 of 10, F3(F4(F6(10)))
		--- cut ---

which parses the file and outputs the result of each $ line on out
